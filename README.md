## How to simulate a single number:

1. Run the program.
2. Input `a` in response to the question.
3. Input the desired number.
4. The program will output the Collatz sequence for the number simulated, and the length of the sequence.

Example output:

```
Welcome to the Collatz Conjecture simulator!
Would you like to simulate a single number, or find the longest number up to a particular number?
Type 'a' to simulate one number, or 'b' to find the longest.
a
Input a positive integer. (1 or greater)
11
11 - 34 - 17 - 52 - 26 - 13 - 40 - 20 - 10 - 5 - 16 - 8 - 4 - 2 - 1
